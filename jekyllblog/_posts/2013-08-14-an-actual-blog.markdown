So it's the second day, and I haven't given up yet! It's hard to tell who I'm writing for, since I haven't really told anyone about this blog yet. Maybe that will be tomorrow's project.

Anyhow, since I now have two posts, I needed a little more infrastructure than my single hand-coded static page solution was offering. Although I'm currently really interested in single-page apps that are heavy on the client and exist only on the server, I definitely don't want to get in over my head working on this blog. After all, the blog isn't the mission &#8210; **making things** is the mission. So I've decided to keep it simple and manageable.

I'm still using static pages, but they're now being generated from [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) by some Ruby code in a framework called [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

There's really something nice about the simplicity and speed of static html. This simplicity won't last long, I'm afraid, because very soon I intend to add the ability for people to comment and tell me how cool (or lame) my project of the day is and whether I should have used framework X rather than Y and why my things aren't working and how to fix them.

I still have a lot of questions about how to do custom stuff using these markdown posts. For example, I have a transparent image of the Jekyll logo above, and it's going to look terrible on a white background &#8210; how do I add a custom css class to the `<img>` tag that's going to be generated? What do I do to create a `<div>` with a custom layout in the article text?

Hopefully Jekyll is flexible enough to keep, but if it's not, it will still have been a cool learning experience (and apparently github pages use it, so I might be interacting with it in that context in the future).

I also put the blog in a github repo [here](https://github.com/zgotsch/making-things-blog). Be sure to submit a pull request if I say something stupid. :p

P.S. I know the layout is a bit bland, I'll try to spruce it up a bit soon.
