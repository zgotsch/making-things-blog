Hello! I am Zach Gotsch, and I have been in a funk recently. I was thinking in
the shower (a place where I do a lot of my best thinking, too bad it's so hard
to write things down in there...) and I think I've figured out why. I've
noticed a recent trend &#8210; I have been consuming _WAY_ more stuff
than I have been creating. One of my core beliefs about people is that the act
of creation, simply _making_ things, is one of our core needs &#8210; I
don't think a person can be truly happy without it. I work on a lot of little
projects, but I'm the kind of person who never seems to finish things.
Something that's incredibly inspiring to me one day can be tiresome and arduous
the next week. My consistent lack of follow-through is really starting to wear
on me. I want to look back on things I've created with pride, rather than
wondering what might have been if I had been more diligent. I think this is why
I've been rather miserable lately, but I have a plan. It's called _making
things_.

I've had a similar phrase stuck in my head for a few months, ever since I
saw a picture of it in the Exploratorium in San Francisco. (Sorry this
looks like it was taken with a potato.)

(Quick side note: if you've never been to the Exploratorium before and you
ever get the chance, I highly recommend it! It's a hands-on science museum
with some amazing exhibits. You should check out their [website](http://www.exploratorium.edu/)

The poster immediately think of one of my friends: Brandon Curtis. The poster
reminds me of Brandon because he's constantly _doing_ things. He builds things
(like [Lord Kelvin's
Thunderstorm](http://makezine.com/projects/make-31/lord-kelvins-thunderstorm/)),
learns things (like [what's actually happening when food
ferments](http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Fermentation-Exploration-Essential/dp/160358286X)),
and just _does_ things like nobody else I know.  He's an inspiration for me,
and I always find myself making and doing things so much more successfully when
I am hanging out with him. (You should totally check out his blog [And Higher
Still](http://www.andhigherstill.com/).)

I think my amazing productivity when I'm hanging out with Brandon gives a
hint at how I can fix my productivity: a little social pressure. So
here's the plan: I am going to post once a day on this blog with
something I've made or something I've been working on making. With any
luck, not wanting to disappoint you will keep me making and you'll be
interested in the stuff I'm churning out. I have a plan: **It's called making
things**.

P.S. Today I made this blog post and the site. I know it's just static html
right now, but I'm working on it :)
