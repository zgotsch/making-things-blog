So today is a bit of a cheat day, since I'm going to be showcasing something
that I made at my job. The reason this is allowed is because I work at pretty
much the most amazing place: **Khan Academy**. I am really interested in education
not only as a problem (it's easy to identify education's shortcomings, and easy
for technologists to envision improvements to the system) but also as a
  _solution_ (with an educated world, problems like disease, poverty, and
  economic inequality are much easier to tackle). So needless to say, working at
  Khan Academy, where our mission is to give "a free world-class education for
  anyone anywhere", is perfect for me.

Today was a big day for us at KA &#8210; we released our new user experience,
the learning dashboard. The learning dashboard is a big improvement for Khan
Academy in a lot of ways. The user experience is a lot better &#8210; students
no longer have to navigate through the knowledge map to find what they want to
learn, everything comes together on their dashboard in the form of data-driven
suggestions for what to work on next. Our model of what it means to _know_ a
skill has also advanced. Our old proficiency model was a simple confidence-based
system that was not very good at discriminating between good pattern-matching
skills and actual understanding. Our new model requires demonstration of
knowledge over time and in a context-switched environment. The end result is a
user experience that is fun and surprisingly _addictive_. I could easily blow
hours just doing math on Khan Academy (and I have), so you should be sure to
check it out at [khanacademy.org](http://khanacademy.org). You can also read
more about it on the official [Khan Academy blog](http://www.khanacademy.org/about/blog).

I get away with posting this because I am one of the lucky KA coders who got to
work on the new design flow. You can even see some of my work on the
screenshots in the blog article (though they were bugged when the screenshots
were taken, oops!) It was a pleasure working on this with all of the KA team,
and we're super excited to see how people use it!

P.S. I looked at the Octopress docs tonight before I wrote this article and it
seems like it's pretty good. Since it's built on top of Jekyll, it seems like a
lot of what I already know will transfer to the new system, awesome!
